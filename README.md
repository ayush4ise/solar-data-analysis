Q - Does climate change have any impact on renewable energy generation?

1980 - 2023 data (for every hour
Jakarta, Japan (Tokyo) and Australia (Brisbane)

Initial Analysis-
data aggregated on a monthly basis

[DONE] every month, avg kW for 7AM   => 24 data points for Jan for 1 year

[DONE] 24 data points for Jan for 44 years

Q - Does it change overtime?
-> Do t-test (?) - 7AM Jan for 44 years

[DONE] If any data points out of the 3 sigma range

(Assume each hour is independent)

[DONE] Can also look for average daily of the month


[DONE] ANOVA for a given hour for a given month, across the years

[DONE] ANOVA for a given hour for a given month, across 4Y blocks and 11Y blocks

[DONE] Can we look at the total daily value for each day in different months? Maybe the hourly fluctuations are too much. Let us try the same things with average daily power generation for each month. And see whether any different. 44 years, Monthly average for 12 months. Then try 4 years blocks and 11 year blocks. And see how the results look like. Maybe plot the graph as as well for each month for 44 years and visually see whether any trend.
